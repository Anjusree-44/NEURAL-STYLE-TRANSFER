# DESCRIPTION

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST) using PyTorch and offers an intuitive, web-based UI using Streamlit. NST is a deep learning technique that takes the content of one image and merges it with the artistic style of another. It uses feature extraction from multiple layers of a pre-trained VGG19 model to compute and optimize style and content representations. The app is optimized for speed and can run efficiently on both CPU and GPU. Users can interactively upload images, trigger style transfer, preview the results, and download the stylized output with minimal effort.

## 📸 What It Does

- Upload a **content image** (e.g. a photo)
- Upload a **style image** (e.g. a painting)
- Generate a stylized version of the content image in the **style of the painting**
- Download the final result

## 🌟 Features

✅ Web-based UI with Streamlit – no need to write code or use command line

📸 Upload your own content and style images directly from your device

🧠 Uses VGG19-based neural style transfer (Gatys et al. 2016)

⚡ Fast processing with reduced image size and optimized steps

📉 Real-time display of stylized output

💾 Download button to save the result as a .jpg image

💻 Runs on CPU or GPU automatically

🧩 Clean and modular code structure (easy to expand)

🛠️ Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux

🧪 Simple to customize: adjust steps, style/content weights, or resolution
